### Musification workshop

Musification workshop introduces participants to everyday sounds as materials for musical expression. The workshop will focus on using transducers to transform everyday objects such as cups and plates into musical instruments. Participants will build a toolkit during the workshop to musically explore everyday objects. They will gain hands-on experience with the fundamentals of electronic music, digital audio, and music technology.

In the past, we have had participants from various backgrounds. Participants were as young as 7 and as old as ~70 whom all did great in completing the workshop agenda. The workshop does recommend to have parents participate together if the child is younger than 12. So far the project completion rate of participants is 100%!
